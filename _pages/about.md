Welcome to my page!

I'm Shouren Wang. I’m currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). Before this, I earned my M.S. degree in Computer Engineering from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) and a B.E. degree in Digital Media Technology from [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/).

My research spans reinforcement learning, creative AI and Large Language Models. Recently, I’ve been working on fancy game-play agent for Street Fighter II as a member of NYU’s Game Innovation Lab and benchmark for long context capabilities of Large Language Models.

I'm still updating this personal page. Please feel free to check if you're interested!
