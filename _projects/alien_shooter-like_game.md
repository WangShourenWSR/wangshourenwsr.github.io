## Introduction
"Nowhere" is an old-school shooting game developed using Unity3D as part of my collaborative undergraduate project at <a href="http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/info/1547/5774.htm">Hunan University Digital Media Technology program</a> . This game adopts a unique isometric shooting gameplay style inspired by the classic game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Shooter">Alien Shooter</a> . Players navigate through challenging levels, fight waves of zombies, and confront a final boss in a post-apocalyptic setting. The project emphasizes technical innovation and creative game design to deliver a hardcore gaming experience.

## Development Highlights
### Technical Highlights
- **Control System:** Developed smooth WSAD-based character movement and mouse-based rotation, with a custom script ensuring stable camera tracking to enhance player experience.
- **Inventory and Item System:** Built a comprehensive inventory system using JSON-based item management for dynamic storage and retrieval. The system supports item pickup, usage, and slot-based organization.
- **Shooting and Combat:** Implemented bullet mechanics using prefabs with particle effects, collision detection, and damage handling. Collaborated on integrating the combat system with zombie AI behavior and gun-specific attributes.
- **Level Design:** Co-designed game levels, including environmental elements, checkpoints, and boss fights, while maintaining a cohesive and immersive atmosphere.

### Creative Highlights

- **Gameplay Design:** Designed and implemented core gameplay elements, including a backpack system, item collection and consumption, character control, shooting mechanics, and a skill system. Unlike linear shooting games like *Alien Shooter*, we enhanced the game with RPG elements such as an inventory and backpack system, a skill system, and a task system. These additions make the game compatible with features like skill trees, equipment crafting, and dungeon exploration, transforming it into a true RPG shooting game.
- **Narrative Design:** Authored the game’s background story inspired by *Resident Evil* series, setting the game in a world plagued by bioengineered zombies. Designed a unique protagonist and storyline to deepen player engagement.
- **Aesthetic Choices:** Developed a dark, post-apocalyptic visual style with rich particle effects, such as glowing items, explosive effects, and dynamic enemy indicators, enhancing the game's atmosphere.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a fully functional prototype of a hardcore RPG shooting game, showcasing both technical depth and creative storytelling. Although there are no current plans for further development, the game possesses significant potential for expansion. Features such as new items, skills, and dungeons could be added to enrich the game’s content with relative ease.
